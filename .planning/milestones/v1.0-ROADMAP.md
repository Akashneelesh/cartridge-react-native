# Milestone v1.0: MVP

**Status:** ✅ SHIPPED 2026-01-12
**Phases:** 1-5
**Total Plans:** 8

## Overview

Build a React Native iOS app that demonstrates Starknet blockchain integration. Starting with Expo project setup and polyfills, we'll add read-only counter display, then Cartridge wallet connection, followed by write transactions, and finally polish with status modals and error handling.

## Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation

**Goal**: Expo project scaffolded with TypeScript, starknet.js, Cartridge SDK, and all required polyfills working
**Depends on**: Nothing (first phase)
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 01-01: Project scaffold and dependencies *(2026-01-11)*
- [x] 01-02: Polyfill configuration and verification *(2026-01-11)*

**Key accomplishments:**
- Expo TypeScript project scaffolded
- starknet.js and Cartridge SDK dependencies installed
- react-native-get-random-values polyfill configured
- Metro bundler configured with crypto resolver
- Node 22 pinned via .nvmrc

### Phase 2: Counter Read

**Goal**: Counter value displays on launch with loading/error states and manual refresh
**Depends on**: Phase 1
**Plans**: 1 plan

Plans:
- [x] 02-01: Starknet provider, contract setup, and counter display UI *(2026-01-11)*

**Key accomplishments:**
- RpcProvider configured for Starknet Sepolia
- Contract instance with get_counter ABI
- Counter display with loading spinner and error states
- Manual refresh button

### Phase 3: Wallet Connection

**Goal**: Cartridge wallet connection flow with address display in UI
**Depends on**: Phase 2
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 03-01: Cartridge controller integration *(2026-01-11)*
- [x] 03-02: Wallet UI (connect button, address display) *(2026-01-11)*

**Key accomplishments:**
- Session-based Cartridge authentication (replacing incompatible web SDK)
- Deep linking for auth callback handling
- Connect/Disconnect UI with truncated address display
- Ephemeral browser sessions for clean account switching

### Phase 4: Counter Write

**Goal**: Increment and decrement counter via signed transactions
**Depends on**: Phase 3
**Plans**: 1 plan

Plans:
- [x] 04-01: Transaction signing with increment/decrement buttons *(2026-01-12)*

**Key accomplishments:**
- increase_counter and decrease_counter ABI added
- Session account creation for transaction signing
- Increment (+) and decrement (-) buttons with styling
- Transaction pending state with loading indicator
- Automatic counter refresh after successful transaction

### Phase 5: Polish

**Goal**: Transaction status modal, Voyager explorer links, graceful error handling throughout
**Depends on**: Phase 4
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 05-01: Transaction status modal *(2026-01-12)*
- [x] 05-02: Explorer links and final error handling *(2026-01-12)*

**Key accomplishments:**
- TransactionModal component with pending/success/error states
- Voyager explorer link for viewing confirmed transactions
- Retry functionality for failed transactions
- User-friendly error messages with context-aware fallbacks
- Retry hints for counter fetch errors

## Milestone Summary

**Key Decisions:**
- iOS only — scope reduction for reference app
- Session-based auth over @cartridge/controller — Web SDK incompatible with RN
- react-native-get-random-values for polyfills — simpler, no native compilation
- starknet.js v9 API syntax — object parameters for Contract and Account constructors
- Unicode symbols for modal icons — avoids external dependency

**Issues Resolved:**
- @cartridge/controller web SDK incompatible with React Native → session-based auth
- Invalid private key generation causing blank Cartridge page → ec.starkCurve.utils.randomPrivateKey()
- starknet.js v9 API syntax differences → object parameter constructors

**Issues Deferred:**
- None

**Technical Debt Incurred:**
- None
